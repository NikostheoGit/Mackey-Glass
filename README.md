The Mackey-Glass equation, widely used to model biological rhythms, is a time-delay chaotic differential
system. In this project, we predict the Mackey-Glass timeseries using a Convolutional Neural Network
on Pytorch, doing both single step predictions and itterative (autoregressive) predictions. Finaly,
we demonstrate the exponential growth of error through timesteps.
